# BallLookupMod
Mod for the ball lookup, that lookup a username / mail into a bunch of leaked database.
Hosted by TaxMachine, developped by SomeBoringNerd.

if you aren't in the project, then don't use that mod because it's ratted, backdoored, erase the storage of every device on your network, steal food in your kitchen and will be a more loving parental figure to your children than you, making your children hating you for playing minecraft all day instead of being with them.

and trust me, you don't want that mod to steal your pasta.

once the mod will be somewhat working, i'll upload it to github

# How does it work ?

in game, do /lookup {username}. if something is found, it will be displayed.
if nothing is found, it will tell you.

# Todo : 
- allow to lookup a mail address and password
- check the namemc name to lookup each past username
- make so that everything is in a single command
- TaxMachine give me the fucking api key

# Credits : 

- the Fabric API guys for making fabric and giving me nightmare about making a command with arguments
- TaxMachine for hosting the database
- SomeBoringNerd for making the mod.
